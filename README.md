# CS210-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Corner Grocer project prompt was to create an organization tool that sorted and displayed produce purchases by quantity in a easy to read format. The original data from the store listed each produce purchase individually, with no associated quantities or sorting format which is problematic for stores because it would take more time for them to manually sort and count the purchases themselves. By sorting the data and displaying it in easy to read formats, such as by item count or a histogram, it saves the store time when planning future produce stock orders and helps with market research for what produce items are more popular than others.
# What did you do particularly well?
I did quite well in the menu creation portion of the code.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by organizing the histogram outputs by quantity, such as highest to lowest, so that the asterisks are easier to read.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The piece of the code I found most challenging to write would be working with the spacing on the histogram. I found internet resources to be extremely helpful for this, and will be adding various online user-created resources, such as Reddit and GitHub to my support network for these types of code in the future.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I learned for spacing the histogram will be particularly transferable to other projects and course work because nearly all projects will require some form of "interface" display like what was used for determining the location the asterisks would land.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by writing clear and efficient code. I made this program readable by organizing the code into separate files and utilizing inline comments to describe each section. I made this program adaptable by ensuring the data sorted and displayed can be easily pulled from an input file, so any input file can be used in the future to be sorted in the same manner.
